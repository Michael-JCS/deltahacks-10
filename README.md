Inspiration ðŸ’¡
Applying to hundreds of jobs with minimal results inspired us to create an app to help younger students craft their first resume, or replace an old resume that does not bring results. Although resume builders do exist, none are able to tailor the resume to showcase student's strength and give attention to details such as the order of elements, and what to and not to include, to give the student the best chance of landing an interview. Resume builders available at the moment are great at crafting beautiful looking resumes, but they are not good resumes.

Our team set out to master the art of building resumes, and our journey started in the Resume Roast event hosted by DeltaHacks. There, we learned key details such as: ideal number of pages (1), how to bold words effectively, and the organization of the elements (experience, projects, education, skills). Then, we continued to learn how to craft the perfect resume through countless interviews with mentors and judges, taking back with us their years of experience applying for jobs and a copy of their resume.

As students in university, we have many different project experiences that, of course, can not all fit on a 1 page resume. This is when applying gets tedious; having to tailor your experiences to different job positions.

What it does ðŸ’»
MakeMyResume prompts users for every piece of information it needs for a resume. Then, the user will be asked to enter all the work and project experiences that they have. To create a resume, the user will enter the job description of the position they wish to apply to as input, and our program will find the relevant experiences that match the job description and use those experiences to build the resume, leaving out the less relevant experiences.
